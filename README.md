# ssdp
Abbreviated version of UPnP SSDP that provides enough information to populate a UPnP device hierarchy (root, embedded devices, and Services) and allow query for device availability. This library requires the additional [UPnPDevice library] ((https://github.com/dltoth/UPnPDevice/) for device structure.
